# MatchaHQ-Web-Development

## Overview 
This is a project I worked on with my friends. Matcha HQ is designed to promote matcha to public, sell food and drinks about matcha online to customers. Information about our restaurant is available all times to anyone with internet access. Within our website, the public may know our operating hours, directions, menu, payment methods, and more. Next, our website also provides pre-orders for dine-in and pick up services. Customers can swipe our online menu anywhere and place and pay their order by choosing dine-in or pick up before they come to our restaurant. Moreover, Matcha HQ website can attract new customers by making announcements about a new recipe, an upcoming event, or special offers. Thus, customers may look at our menu online and decide to come to our restaurant.
